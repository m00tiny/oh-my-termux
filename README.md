Setup Termux with:

 - Solarized Dark
 - Ubuntu Mono with powerline patch
 - oh-my-zsh

# Requirement
- git bash
```
apt update && apt upgrade && apt install git
```

# Installation
Not really meant to be installed unless you happen to use a similar base.  Should fork the repo and edit install.sh or just write something better and less sloppy.
```
git clone https://github.com/m00tiny/oh-my-termux/ .oh-my-termux && bash .oh-my-termux/install.sh
```
